This is a command-line tool that handles every step of generating the release files for your Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on for you.

It can:

-   Add the files from your development behavior and resource packs into a .mcaddon file.
-   Remove development folders such as `src` and `node_modules`.
-   Remove development files such as `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
-   Update the add-on's version number.
-   Apply any desired modifications to the release files automatically, including adding, removing, renaming, and moving file and folders.

It uses a configuration file called `add-on-releaser-config.json` to specify the options.

You can have as many packs as you want included in the .mcaddon file.

## Installation

```
npm i -g add-on-releaser
```

```
Usage:

add-on-releaser [configPath]

Parameters:
